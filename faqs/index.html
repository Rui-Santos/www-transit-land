           Transitland is an “open” project. That’s a vague and overused word--still, “open” is a great goal.

          <b>Software</b> Transitland is built using exclusively open-source software. When possible, we release new tools under flexible licenses like MIT that allow use in both non-commercial and commercial settings.

          <b>Direction</b> Transitland is sponsored by Mapzen. It’s staff employed at Mapzen who have created Transitland and are setting its direction. We welcome partners who would like to be involved in Transitland, especially those who care about technical nuts-and-bolts and those who care about building a system that’s useful for enthusiasts and non-experts. (There are already venues for negotiating data-interoperability specifications and debating general transit/transportation/planning topics. The point of Transitland is to create transit data services that work--even if they’re not perfect be-all-end-alls.)
