<p><b>Transitland Feed Registry</b> is a directory of public-transit operators and their authoritative data feeds. The directory is a view into Transitland's Datastore API. It lets users browse operators and their feeds, as well as view the license restrictions on each feed and contribute additional operators and feeds.</p>

<p><b>Transitland Datastore</b> brings together data from authoritative sources (listed in the Feed Registry) with contributions, edits, and fixes from transit enthusiasts and developers. It's a hosted service that provides a simple web API for query and editing.</p>

<p><b>Transitland Playground:</b> If the Feed Registry and Datastore are frozen and underwater, then the Playground is the tip of that iceberg, demonstrating all the pieces of the data architecture working together.</p>

<p>But we're not trying to sink ships, here. We're actively recruiting contributors, users, partners, critics, and imitators. All of Transitland's software components are available under open-source licenses; all of the data (federated from authoritative sources and contributed by community members) is freely available. You can participate in Transitland by using just one component of this architecture, or come for it all.</p>
