madeinsf: "<p>Hello from the San Francisco Bay Area, where half of the ground is heading northbound and the other is inching southward. (Remember from elementary school? That’s what causes earthquakes.)</p><p>Also epically disjoint is our mass transit: over 30 public agencies, an ever-increasing number of private shuttles, not to mention jitneys and carpools welcoming those in the know.</p><p>Our goal at Transitland is to make sense of this jumble. We’re mapping those buses, trains, streetcars, ferries, and even cable cars. Clarification: We’re aggregating existing geographic and temporal data from authoritative sources; we’re connecting the dots using common identifiers;.</p>"
howitworks: "The Bay Area is our laboratory. The world is our goal. Seriously, transit-network data is useful in many places big, small, rich, poor. So, we’re trying to create is a modular, open-source data service that can work all over."
