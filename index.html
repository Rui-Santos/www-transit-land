madeinsf: "<p>Hello from the San Francisco Bay Area, where half of the ground is heading northbound and the other is inching southward. (Remember from elementary school? That’s what causes earthquakes.) Also epically disjoint is our mass transit: over 30 public agencies, an ever-increasing number of private shuttles, not to mention jitneys and carpools welcoming those in the know. Our goal at Transitland is to make sense of this jumble. We’re mapping those buses, trains, streetcars, ferries, and even cable cars. Clarification: We’re aggregating existing geographic and temporal data from authoritative sources; we’re connecting the dots using common identifiers;.</p>"
howitworks: "The Bay Area is our laboratory. The world is our goal. Seriously, transit-network data is useful in many places big, small, rich, poor. So, we’re trying to create is a modular, open-source data service that can work all over."
playground: "Take a look at our playground. API playground is the tip of that iceberg, demonstrating all the pieces of the data architecture working together. "
participate: "Transitland is in its early stages. We welcome transit enthusiasts, community builders, public servants, and collaborative companies to help shape its future"
