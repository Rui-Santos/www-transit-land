title: Routes and route stop patterns
layout: documentation
---

<p>Transit routes are geographical areas of service. Transitland has two models to effectively represent routes and their connection to services:
 the <code>Route</code> and the <a href="#route_stop_patterns">RouteStopPattern</a>. Routes are essentially a summary of the aggregate characteristics of the whole transit route. RouteStopPatterns are geographical representations of the services that make up the Route.</code></p>

<h5>Route Representative Geometry</h5>
<p>The Route model geometry is a representation of the actual given route geometry, and may not contain every path from the original data. The Route geometry is primarily for visualizing the route as a whole as efficiently as possible; a complete (but often redundant) set of the geometry would be the set of all the Route's RouteStopPatterns. To compute this geometry, a sample of the Route's RouteStopPatterns is chosen by mapping every sequential pair of stops to a list of RouteStopPatterns that visit the stop pair.
    A single RouteStopPattern is chosen from each of those lists, and those chosen RouteStopPatterns make up the sample. After a representative selection of RouteStopPatterns is made,
    Douglas-Peucker algorithm is applied to remove coordinates that are extraneous to a visualization. It is important to note that if there are two distinct paths for a single sequential stop pair, only one of those paths might end up being chosen. This is why the Route geometry is not always a complete representation of the true geometry.</p>

<!--

<p>TODO: include some example API query URLs</p>
-->

<h3><a name="route_stop_patterns">RouteStopPattern</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the Route, Transitland models route geometries by breaking them into individual components called RouteStopPatterns, or sometimes RSPs. RouteStopPatterns are uniquely defined by a route, a stop pattern, and a line geometry; all three derived from the trip routes, trip stop sequences, and shapes of a GTFS feed and its services. Because of this, it is possible to have two distinct RouteStopPatterns within one route, both sharing the same line geometry but having different stop patterns, and vice versa. Individual RouteStopPatterns also have records of the GTFS trips and the single shape used to create them; a typical RouteStopPattern will reference back to one or many trips having the same stop pattern, but only references the one shape shared by those trips. When a RouteStopPattern's trips have no shapes or empty shapes, there will be no shape reference.</p>

<p>RouteStopPatterns may also modify the original shape line geometry if necessary. Currently, the line geometry is only modified when it is generated as the result of missing its original GTFS shape id or shape points. In this case, the line geometry becomes the sequential points of the stop pattern, and a separate boolean named `is_generated` will be set to true.</p>

<h5>Onestop ID</h5>
<p>RouteStopPatterns are uniquely identified by a Onestop Id, but the composition of this id is different from that of Route, Stop, Feed, and Operator Onestop Ids. The RouteStopPattern Onestop Id has 5 components instead of 3, with each component separated by a dash just as the ids of the latter Transitland entities. The first 3 components are exactly the Route Onestop Id of the Route to which the RouteStopPattern belongs to. The fourth component is the first 6 hexadecimal characters of the MD5 hash produced from the stop pattern string (stop onestop id's separated by comma). The fifth component is the first 6 hexadecimal characters of the MD5 hash produced from geometry coordinates as a string (coordinates separated by comma).</p>

<h5>Distance calculation heuristic algorithm</h5>
<p>RouteStopPatterns' <code>stop_distances</code> are useful for cutting a slice of the route line between two stops for visualization, among other reasons. Each <a href="schedules.html"><code>ScheduleStopPair</code></a> has a RouteStopPattern. In addition, two attributes have been added to ScheduleStopPair: <code>origin_distance_traveled</code> and <code>destination_distance_traveled</code>. These are the distances, in meters rounded to the nearest decimeter, of the origin and destination stops along the line geometry from the start point.</p>

<p>The current algorithm runs as follows. While iterating through each stop of the RouteStopPattern, we look ahead to the next stop (if there is one), and behind to the previous stop (if there is one). For the stop point ahead, we find the globally closest segment match. Lets call this segment <code>c</code>. For the stop behind, we use the previously found matching segment. Let’s call that segment <code>a</code>. If there is no previous stop, we use the first segment of the line. Then for the segments in between our two segments <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>, we find the closest match. Let’s call that segment “b.” With "b" we compute the closest point to the stop along that segment, then compute the distance along the line to that point. Sometimes the <code>b</code> segment results in a distance that is less than the previous stop’s distance. If this happens, we bump up our <code>a</code> segment index by 1 and try again.</p>

<p>The distance calcuation is not always perfect, unfortunately. Transitland logs inaccuraties through <a href="quality_issues.html">Quality Issues.</a> If any inaccuracies are found for a particular RouteStopPattern, the <code>stop_distances</code> for that RouteStopPattern are set to null.</p>

<a name="before-and-after-stops"></a>
<h5>Before and After Stops</h5>
<p>Sometimes stops at the beginning and end of route lines are found to be off the route line. We need to identify these stops so that their distances can be set to 0.0 meters for stops before the route line, and the length of the route line for stops after. Here are the conditions for determining these "before" and "after" stops. A stop is considered to be before (after) a RouteStopPattern line geometry if its point satisfies one of two conditions:

  <ol>
    <li>It is found on the opposite side of the line that is perpendicular to the first (last) line segment and that passes through the first (last) endpoint of the segment.</li>
    <li>It is greater than 100 meters distant from any point in the line geometry.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For example:</p>

  Before:
<pre>
    |
  x |----------->
    |
</pre>

  Before:
<pre>
 |
 |----------->
 | ]  100 m
            x
</pre>
  Not before:
<pre>
|
|----------->
| x   ]  100 m
</pre>
