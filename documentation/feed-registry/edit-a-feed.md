After a feed is part of the Feed Registry, you can modify the feed's details, including updating the license status or correcting information.

1. Navigate to the [Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/) and click Add a feed. You can also start directly from [https://transit.land/feed-registry/feeds/new](https://transit.land/feed-registry/feeds/new).
2. Find the URL of the feed. You can get the URL by clicking a feed in the Feed Registry and looking under the Feed Details section. Note: To replace the URL of an existing feed and have Transitland check the feed from a different location, enter the new URL here. 
3. Paste the address into the text box.
4. Click Next.
5. If a matching operator is found, you see a notification that you are in a mode where you can edit a feed. If no existing operators are found, you are adding the feed. 
6. Modify only the details you want to change about the feed. 
7. Submit the feed.

To learn more about what goes in the feed details, see [Add a feed](add-a-feed.md).
