*Coverage map of the United States, [created by Kuan Butts](https://twitter.com/buttsmeister/status/913445125396639744), using data from Transitland*

The Transitland [Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/) has maps, schedules, stops, and routes information for 882 transit feeds containing over 2,274 transit operators. Our datastore, however, is still missing hundreds of cities and operators around the world. We've started documenting areas of the world that we don't have by identifying specific cities and operators within those cities for which we cannot find GTFS feeds. 

Our current coverage of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and most countries in Europe is excellent, and we have very good coverage of the most populated areas in Australia and New Zealand. 

The initial group of "placeholders", as we're calling them, was populated by identifying the most populous cities in the world that are missing from our map. In addition, I also added cities that are in regions and continents that have less representation in our map. This includes cities in South America, India, South Korea, and one country in Africa. 

The placeholders list is incomplete, and we're asking for help from people who live in these areas to help us find GTFS feeds if they're available, or educate transit operators and encourage them to develop a feed. The benefits of having a feed listed in our Feed Registry and integrated in our data store are that makes it easier for app developers to include transit service in those cities in their apps, and researchers can analyze the quality of transit service around the world. 

## We could use your knowledge
We have very limited coverage of metropolitan areas in **South Asia**, **Southeast Asia**, **Japan**, **Africa**, and **South America**. We have no data for anywhere in **China**. 

Send us the name and location of a missing transit operator in those areas if you're familiar with them, [through our Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMMVmGnfrlwpbZViW16bvQ99Sb1y1bRuNqKtUk_7ZEFfon1w/viewform). 

You can explore the coverage we have in the world using [Mobility Explorer](https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer/). Search or pan to any area on earth and click "show operators".
