*Map showing most of our transit coverage of the world, some of which may be hard to see, [created by Kuan Butts](https://twitter.com/buttsmeister), using data from Transitland (see more maps below)*

The Transitland [Feed Registry](https://transit.land/feed-registry/) has maps, schedules, stops, and routes information for 879 transit feeds containing over 2,275 transit operators. Our current coverage of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and most countries in Europe is excellent, and we have very good coverage of the most populated areas in Australia and New Zealand.

Our datastore, however, is still missing hundreds of cities and operators around the world. We've started documenting areas of the world that we don't have in our coverage by identifying specific cities and operators within those cities for which we cannot find GTFS feeds. 

The initial group of 50 "placeholders", [as we're calling them](https://github.com/transitland/transitland/issues/261), was populated by identifying the most populous cities in the world that are missing from our map. In addition, I also added cities that are in regions and continents that have less representation in our map. The placeholders group includes cities in South America, India, South Korea, and in one country in Africa. These have been added to our coverage map, but we don't have schedules, stops, and routes information for them.  

The placeholders list is incomplete, and we're asking for help from people who live in these areas to help us find GTFS feeds if they're available, or educate transit operators and encourage them to develop a feed. The benefits of having a feed listed in our Feed Registry and integrated in our data store are that makes it easier for app developers to include transit service in those cities in their apps, and researchers can analyze the quality of transit service around the world. 

## We could use your knowledge

**We have very limited coverage of metropolitan areas in**:

- South Asia
- Southeast Asia
- Japan
- Africa
- South America
- China

[Send us the name and location](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMMVmGnfrlwpbZViW16bvQ99Sb1y1bRuNqKtUk_7ZEFfon1w/viewform) of a missing transit operator in those areas if you're familiar with them [through our Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMMVmGnfrlwpbZViW16bvQ99Sb1y1bRuNqKtUk_7ZEFfon1w/viewform) â€“ whether or not they have a GTFS feed. If you know the GTFS feed, [submit it to the Feed Registry here](https://transit.land/feed-registry/feeds/new).

(We are also missing operators from elsewhere in the world, but please check our Feed Registry before submitting a place outside the countries listed above.)

You can explore the coverage we have in the world using [Mobility Explorer](https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer/). Search or pan to any area on earth and click "show operators".

*Kuan also made a map of South America, but our coverage isn't expansive enough to be visibile across the large continent in the map.*
