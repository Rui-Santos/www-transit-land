### Italian transit collection growing

<p class='caption'>We're working to include all of the transit data feeds for Italy, and the world. Photo of a train in Torre Pellice in the Piedmont region of Italy by Antonio Martinetti</p>

Since March, when we added our first feeds of transit operators in Italy to the Transitland Feed Registry, we've added 27 more! Hi, I'm Steven Vance, and I just started working for Mapzen last week, reviewing new and edited feed submissions to Transitland for the next few months. When I started looking through the submissions last week I noticed that there was a backlog of many transit feeds from just three Italian contributors. I got to work reviewing their submissions.

In the process I learned a little Italian, realized that "regions" are official Italian administrative boundaries (there are 20 of them), and delved into some of the complexity of European public transport association hierarchies. 

Transitland's Feed Registry now has feeds from transit operators in Florence, Venice, Palermo, Naples, Milan, Bari, Turin, Rome, and Bologna, among others.  Even after processing over two dozen feeds, there are nearly 100 more left to review. And that's just from the collection that has been submitted by our generous contributors. 

Right now I'm working through a massive combined feed for the [_Piemonte_ (Piedmont) region](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/404227493/#7/45.275/7.920). The capital is Turin, which is also a province. The region contains part of the Alps mountain range and borders France and Switzerland. 

The feed is managed by the Piedmont government, and comes from [their open data website](http://www.dati.piemonte.it). It contains feeds for 86 operators. Since we prefer to keep combined feeds together, this one will take longer because each of the operators' medata needs to be individually verified.
