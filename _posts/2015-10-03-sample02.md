 - **Return to Route:**  most phone based navigation applications require contacting a server when a user deviates from the specified route path, even for common cases like stopping for fuel or food. With graph tiles downloaded along the route path, the navigation application can find a path back to the route without an expensive call to the routing server.

 - **Enhanced Navigation:** tiles along the route allow more detailed information to be presented along the route without having to increase the payload in the initial call to the routing service. Exits along the highway, names of upcoming roads, and other information can be presented when graph tiles are present.

We're excited with what we've accomplished so far, and look forward to showing you more soon. We plan to launch an open routing service as well as downloadable tiles later in the year. In the meantime though, [have a quick browse of the code](https://github.com/valhalla), read more about THOR [in our previous blog post](https://mapzen.com/blog/valhalla-intro), and reach out if something doesn't make sense!
