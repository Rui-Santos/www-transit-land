## Taking regional trains from a city of 12,000 to a city of 155,000 is a piece of cake

*I've done my best trying to make sense of how regional transit providers in one part of Germany are organized, but if you think I could be more accurate, please email XXX@mapzen.com.*

In June my sister and I traveled to Germany. I went to visit a friend I met in Chicago and it was my sister's first trip in Europe. We stayed with my friend in Ladenburg, a village of about 12,000 people in the state Baden-Württemberg, and equidistant to Mannheim and Heidelberg. 

Ladenburg has a train station with three tracks and two platforms. During our stay there the third track was under construction. We visited Heidelberg twice, taking trains from Ladenburg on both days. 

We traveled at the same time each day – between 12:00 and 14:00 – so it caught my attention that the second journey into Heidelberg – a city with a large, well-known university – took a different route than the trip the day before. 

On the second day the same trip – starting in Ladenburg and arriving in Heidelberg – had us taking a different route by stopping at the Mannheim-Seckenheim station. 

For a city of 12,000, I was impressed that there was regional train service six times per hour between Ladenburg and Heidelberg. Back home, in Chicago, commuter trains come once an hour between rush hour periods. 

The train service and connections were so incredibly well-timed and on-time that we waited less than eight minutes between trains. Overall the two-train journey took about 12 minutes longer than the single-train journey the day before, and, owing to good fare integration, cost the same. Two of the train services each hour are 15 minutes, non-stop. Our service, part of two other services each hour, was 27 minutes, including the eight minutes transfer, and the third service with twice-hourly trips takes 37 minutes because of a longer transfer in a different city. 

This kind of rigid, rider-friendly timing on a two-seat ride wasn't devised by mistake. It's often prohibitively expensive to run transit routes non-stop between every origin and destination. Airlines don't do it exclusively, and though the Personal Rapid Transit system in Morgantown does that during off-peak hours, it has five stations and only the smaller, less-used PRT at Heathrow airport has been built since.

Running a transit system where vehicles, operated by one or more companies, as in Germany, "meet" each other is a hallmark of a well-integrated system. 

The current organization of public transport in Germany lends itself to high-quality service characteristics like low headways (the time between vehicles at a particular stop) and high frequency, and short waits for a transfer vehicle. German local and regional transit operations are more complex because of the interconnected relationships among governments on all levels, public and private companies, and companies that are simply in charge of scheduling. 

In the USA, there are typically two structures. The first, most commonly found in the largest cities, is that all transit service is provided by a governmental corporation created by authority of the state's legislature. In Chicago, where I live, the Chicago Transit Authority, Pace, and Metra, are state-owned corporations. They were created by the state legislature and can only be dissolved or merged by an action of the state legislature. They operate independently from the state legislature by having an appointed board and a president that the board presumably selects. 

The second structure is for the transit agency to be a department of a city or county's transportation or public works department. 

The three transit agencies in Chicago are unique in that some of their actions are subject to ineffective service planning and financial oversight from the Regional Transportation Authority. 

In Germany however, there are multiple layers, and they start with regions, not states. Heidelberg, Ladenburg, and Mannheim, for example, are all in the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, named after the two rivers that converge in Mannheim. 

The Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN) is a "network" that sets the fares and coordinates routes and timed transfers for transit in the region – including both public and private agencies that operate buses and trains in the area. 

The VRN is singly owned by the Zweckverband Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (ZRN), a special purpose group specific to Germany that allows local government authorities to form an association. Other examples of zweckverbands in Germany include unions that run hospitals and ambulance services. The three states, and 24 cities, city districts, and counties in the Rhein-Neckar region make up the ZRN.

The transit operator in this region is a separate company called Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr (RNV). RNV was created and is owned, jointly, by the five former transit operators in the region. On trams in Heidelberg you'll see the RNV logo, but the logo for the old HSB, or Heidelberger Straßen- und Bergbahn, is also there!

RNV, the main transit operator, and the Unternehmensgesellschaft Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (URN), a union of over 50 transit operators, are members of the VRN network. 

The RNV, like many other operators in Germany, has its own subsidiary company, operating buses in Viernheim, Hesse. John Pucher and Ralph Buehler wrote in their 2010 paper "Making public transport financially sustainable" that companies use new subsidiaries to control labor costs because employees of the new companies have new contracts, that may have different wages and work rules, but also to grow the company. "Transit agencies are planning to use these new subsidiaries to win bids in future calls for tender in other cities and regions—thus potentially increasing the company’s market share and geographic reach."

Deutsche Bahn, or DB, is also a relevant part of any discussion about transit in Germany. The national railway, a privately-run company owned entirely by the federal government, no longer operates all of the country's regional trains (the routes DB is still contracted to operate have the brand names RegioExpress and RegioBahn).

The history and organization of DB is, itself, complex. For example, DB purchased United Kingdom-based Arriva in 2010. Arriva, now a subsidiary of DB, operates trains in the UK, including London Overground commuter trains (through a consortium with Hong Kong-based MTR), and trains in the Netherlands, among other places. 

Regional train services from Mannheim to Heidelberg are contracted to DB Regio Südwest by the states of Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, parts of Baden-Württemberg and Hesse. However, the states are free to issue a tender and receive bids from any other company authorized to run trains in the country, including DB. That change occurred in 1996, two years after DB was formed, and when railway operations were deregulated in Germany. Later, the European Union passed a directive that will eventually require open competition for train routes across members states. 

At the end of the day, this integrated web of companies, subsidiaries, operators, networks, and schedules doesn’t really matter to the rider: which company operates which route has no bearing on the rider. A single organization – VRN, the "network" company for Heidelberg – is in charge of the timetables, and in providing GTFS feeds for Transitland. VRN is in charge of standardizing fares across and between cities and operators. 

The three agencies in Chicago are moving slowly to have fare integration, but there are no visible efforts to coordinate transfers. Last year it became possible to use a single online payment account to pay for rides on CTA, Pace, and Metra, although with two fare mediums. Riders use a chip card to ride CTA and Pace, but must have an app to buy Metra tickets using the same electronic fare money.
