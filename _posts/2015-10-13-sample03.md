#### A bit of the Who, When and How


17/11/14 07:03 EST **Dave:** Hmm... Tiled. Hierarchical. Open. Routing. We could call it THOR. That's a pretty sweet acronym! That will make a great project name. But yeah... I'm not sure it'll work.

Ok, so the above is slightly embellished (everyone knows Dave stopped answering his phone after that one weekend call about traffic on the NJ Turnpike), and let's just say Kevin's proposal was met with some degree of skepticism. But after reasoned consideration the team decided that tiled, hierarchical routing data had merits and was worth pursuing.

### Show me the What, Where and Why!

So you can find all of our software at our [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla) github organization. There's a lot of software there but most of it is modern c++ with a little bit of python for prototypes, a bit of ruby for chef style deployment and a bit of javascript for demo'ing some of the functionality.
